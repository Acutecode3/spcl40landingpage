        Interacting with thousands of students every day has made us realise
        that our cause is genuine and relevant. While examinations and
        certificates take precedence in colleges, the graduates are left largely
        underskilled for today{"'"}s competitive world. This makes them unfit
        for employment, and we understand how dire their future will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our programme has{" "}
        <span className="bold">
          transformed the careers of hundreds of hand-picked students,
        </span>{" "}
        and we look forward to upskilling many more!
